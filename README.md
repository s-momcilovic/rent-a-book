# Book Rental Website

Developed a user-friendly website for renting books using PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. Users can easily browse, borrow, and return books. Collaborated with a team and created clear documentation for the project.

This project highlights my web development skills, teamwork, and commitment to user-friendly solutions.
